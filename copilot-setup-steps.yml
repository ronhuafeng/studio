# GitHub Copilot Setup Steps for FMEA Visualizer
# This file provides setup instructions for the FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) Visualizer project

name: FMEA Visualizer Setup
description: |
  A Next.js application for visualizing FMEA data with AI-powered analysis capabilities.
  This project includes both a React Flow-based frontend for graph visualization and 
  an optional Genkit AI backend for intelligent FMEA processing.

prerequisites:
  - Node.js (version 20 or higher)
  - npm (comes with Node.js)

    command: "npm run dev"
    notes: "This starts the main UI and standard Next.js API routes"
    
  - step: "Start the AI backend (optional)"
    description: "Run the Genkit AI server for AI-powered features in a separate terminal"
    command: "npm run genkit:watch"
    notes: "Only needed if working with AI features. Usually runs on port 4000"
    optional: true
